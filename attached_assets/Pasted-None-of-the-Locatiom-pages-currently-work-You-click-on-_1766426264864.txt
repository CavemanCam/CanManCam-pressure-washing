None of the Locatiom pages currently work. You click on one of the neighborhoods and it just brings you to a white screen.

The reviews section on the home page asre not the real reviews from the google profile I gave you. Here is that link again: 

The review page itself is also not updated with this as well.https://share.google/XCgU4IvpDNVdyXm1v

The logo in the header is also extremely small. You need to enlarge it much more as it's not even really legible.

The Leave a Google Review CTA in the feedback page does not bring you to the actual leave a sreview pasge, that can be found: https://g.page/r/CYM5xsjZAqS2EBM/review
The send direct feedback also takes you to a unusable link. LEt's link them to emailing us instead.

In the footer, in the contact us column, there is a random P, E and A next to phone, email and service area that needs to be removed.

When you are scrolled down on a page for example, and you click on a CTA to another page, it does not bring you to the top of the new page. if a customer clicks on a new link, it shoudl automatically bring them to the top of the new page.

MOST pages have basically NO photos at all leaving it just a big wall of text on each and every page. We need to fix this. Create a plan for this while creating placeholders for now and then taking note what photos I need to uplaod to put in these sections. All pages need to be researched and looked at to see if images would be beneficial or not.

We need to make it known where appliciable, the our hours are open 24/7.

In the Price beast guarantee section in the home page, there is a Why Soft Wash? to the right which doesn't make sense to be in the same section. We need to move this somewhre else or remove it completely.

In the Contact Page, next to easch contact method there is a letter, P,E,H,S. Not sure why you did that but it doesn't make sense. Please remove.

Also in the contact, here is the link to embed the service map: <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d107260.12761002278!2d-79.81088229999999!3d32.8484556!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x486774fb38b3d117%3A0xb6a402d9c8c63983!2sCanman%20Cam!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1766426214312!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

We need to also implement this map into the footer of our pages for help with seo optimization
